"""
Visione - CLIP2Video Feature Extraction Service Package.

This package contains the service implementation for extracting
video and text features using the CLIP2Video model.
It is designed to be run as a standalone service, typically within a Docker container.
"""

# This __init__.py file marks the directory as a Python package.
# For a standalone service like this, it often remains minimal.

# If there were components intended for direct import by other Visione modules
# (outside this service's direct operational scope), they could be exposed here.
# For example:
# from .service import CLIP2VideoFeatureExtractor, app

# However, given the service-oriented architecture, direct imports are less common.
